# Basic_stats_python
In this notebook, we will explore how to use Python for performing the most common statistical analysis, especially in the field of medicine. I have developed various functions that facilitate the analysis of variables and the automated execution of appropriate statistical tests. This work also demonstrates how to overcome a limitation in Python by applying the Fisher test to tables larger than 2x2. As a bonus, we have created a custom encoding function that, unlike Scikit-Learn's LabelEncoder, allows encoding variable values while ignoring missing values. I undertook this work as part of research efforts for a medical colleague. I hope you find it useful. Please feel free to report any issues or ask questions.
